## Governance and Flexibility

The community can dynamically adjust the burn cadence through governance to maintain a flexible and responsive coin economy. This decentralized approach aims to align incentives and safeguard the long-term health of the XODE ecosystem.

## Conclusion

XODE’s tokenomics emphasize long-term value creation, stability, and community empowerment. A significant lockup with a governance-managed burn, coupled with strategic allocations for liquidity, development, marketing, partnerships, and reserves, provides a balanced and robust foundation for sustainable growth. Stakeholders are invited to help build a decentralized, resilient, and thriving XODE ecosystem.
