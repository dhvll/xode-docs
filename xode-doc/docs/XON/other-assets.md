### Lite Node Technology
Most blockchain user interfaces connect to centralized servers (like PolkadotJS), creating single points of failure. While full nodes provide trustless interaction, they require substantial knowledge and resources.

Lite nodes connect to the peer-to-peer network and interact with multiple full nodes without requiring continuous operation or extensive storage. They rely on full nodes for information retrieval while maintaining security.

### Use Cases
- **Governance**: $XAV holders can participate in protocol upgrades and parameter changes through on-chain voting
- **Staking**: Validators and nominators stake $XAV for block production and validation
- **Transaction Fees**: $XAV is used to pay transaction fees on the Xaver network

### Sample Reward Computation
- Total staked XAV: 10,000,000 XAV
- Total reward pool: 1,000 XAV (per era)
- Number of nodes: 1,000
- Node blocks produced: 10
- Total blocks in era: 1,000

**Calculation**:
- Block production rewards: (10/1,000) ร 1,000 XAV = 10 XAV
- Block verification rewards: 1,000 XAV รท 1,000 = 1 XAV
- **Total reward**: 10 XAV + 1 XAV = 11 XAV

### Meme Token Characteristics
Meme tokens are typically created for entertainment based on internet memes rather than serious investment purposes. They often feature humorous themes and may lack fundamental utility but can gain popularity through viral nature and community enthusiasm.

![Meme Token](./img/MemeToken.png)

Meme tokens can gain popularity and traction based on their novelty or viral nature, leading to speculative trading and rapid price movements. However, they are generally considered highly risky and volatile investments, as they may lack any real value or utility beyond their entertainment factor. Examples of meme tokens include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and many others that have emerged in the cryptocurrency space.

### Community Popularity

It has also experienced periods of speculative trading, leading to fluctuations in its price. While Meme Coin may not have the same level of serious development and utility as some other cryptocurrencies, its enthusiastic community and unique culture have helped it maintain a presence in the crypto space for many years.
