# XON Utility Token

XON is the native utility token of the XODE Blockchain. It underpins network security, governance, liquidity, and economic activity across the ecosystem.

## Governance

XON holders can participate in on-chain governance by proposing and voting on protocol changes, runtime upgrades, and treasury spending. Governance ensures the community steers XODE’s evolution in a transparent, decentralized manner.

## Staking

XON powers XODE’s consensus via collator selection and backing:

- Collators stake XON to become eligible for block authorship.
- Nominators delegate XON to trusted collators to help secure the network.
- Rewards are distributed to active collators and their nominators based on performance and stake.

## Bonding (Liquidity Provision)

XON is also used to provide liquidity in decentralized exchanges (DEXs):

- Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit equal value of both assets in a pair (e.g., XON/USDT) into a pool.
- LPs receive pool tokens representing their share and earn trading fees (and potentially incentives) proportional to their contribution.
- Bonding XON into liquidity pools deepens market liquidity and reduces slippage for traders.

## Fees

Transaction fees and other computational costs on XODE are paid in XON. Fees help:

- Prevent spam and abuse by assigning costs to resource consumption.
- Fund on-chain mechanisms (e.g., treasury) per network economics.
- Prioritize transactions under congestion via fee markets.

## Why XON Matters

- Secures the network through staking and honest-collator incentives.
- Aligns stakeholders via governance and treasury.
- Enables liquidity and robust token markets.
- Pays for execution, storage, and cross-chain interactions.

XON’s multi-role design makes it integral to XODE’s security, performance, and long-term sustainability.
